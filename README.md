# Employee's_Absenteeism
# Project Overview
Employee absenteeism is a major challenge that impacts productivity, team performance, and business costs. This project analyzes attendance data to uncover patterns and key factors driving absenteeismâ€”such as health, commuting distance, workload, and seasonal trends.
In addition to analysis, it applies predictive models to forecast absenteeism risk, enabling HR teams to take proactive steps like flexible work policies or wellness programs. The goal is to show how data-driven insights can help organizations improve workforce planning, reduce disruptions, and support employee well-being.
